# Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project segments customers into distinct groups based on purchasing behavior using clustering techniques. The insights enable businesses to:
- Develop targeted marketing strategies.
- Enhance customer retention.
- Optimize resource allocation.

## Key Features
- **Dataset**: Online Retail Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- **Metrics**: Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM).
- **Clustering**: K-Means with the Elbow Method to determine optimal clusters.
- **Validation**: Silhouette Score to measure cluster quality.

## Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Results
- Identified three distinct customer segments:
  1. **High-value loyal customers**
  2. **Low-value infrequent buyers**
  3. **Moderate-value occasional buyers**

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open and run `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment or Google Colab.

## Visualizations
Scatter plots were created to visualize cluster distributions and understand segment characteristics.
