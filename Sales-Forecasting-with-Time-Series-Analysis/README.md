## Introduction

Retail trade volume forecasting is critical for strategic planning, inventory management, and marketing campaigns. This project employs the ARIMA model, a powerful tool for time series analysis, to forecast retail trade volumes for the upcoming year with high confidence and accuracy.

---

## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess historical retail trade data.
- Decompose the time series to analyze trend, seasonality, and residual components.
- Train an ARIMA model to generate forecasts.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE and MAE.
- Provide actionable insights based on forecasted values.

---

## Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning and Visualization**:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values.
   - Visualize trends and seasonal patterns.

2. **Time Series Decomposition**:
   - Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components to understand underlying structures.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Check for stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test.
   - Fit an ARIMA model with optimized parameters (p, d, q).

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Analyze residuals to ensure no autocorrelation and validate model adequacy.
   - Evaluate performance using RMSE and MAE metrics.

5. **Forecasting**:
   - Generate forecasts for the next 12 months and visualize them alongside confidence intervals.

6. **Actionable Insights**:
   - Provide recommendations for inventory, marketing, and operational planning.

## Results and Key Insights

- **Model Performance**:
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 22.46
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 17.56

- **Forecasted Trends**:
  - Retail trade volume shows stabilization with minimal fluctuations over the forecast horizon.

- **Actionable Insights**:
  - Use forecasts to optimize inventory and marketing strategies.
  - Update the model as new data becomes available to maintain accuracy.
